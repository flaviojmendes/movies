# Indie Game

Indie Game: The Movie is a 2012 documentary film by Canadian filmmakers James Swirsky and
Lisanne Pajot. The film documents the struggles of independent game developers Edmund McMillen
and Tommy Refenes during the development of Super Meat Boy, Phil Fish during the development of
Fez, and also Jonathan Blow, who reflects on the success of Braid.

After two successful Kickstarter funds, interviews were conducted with prominent indie developers
 within the community. After recording over 300 hours of footage, Swirsky and Pajot decided to cut
  the movie down to follow the four developers selected.[4] Their reasoning behind this was to show
  game development in the "past, present and future" tenses through each individual's story.
