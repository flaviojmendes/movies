# Steve Jobs, The Lost Interview

Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview is a documentary released to theaters in 2012.
It consists of the original 70 minute interview that Steve Jobs gave to Robert X.
Cringely in 1995 for the PBS documentary, Triumph of the Nerds.

The original interview that Jobs gave to Cringely for Triumph of the Nerds lasted about 70 minutes.
 Of those 70 minutes, only about 10 were used in Triumph of the Nerds.
  When Jobs gave this interview in 1995, he was still "two years away from retaking the
  Chief Executive role at Apple and beginning a run that would transform the Cupertino,
  Calif.-based Mac maker from loser to leader in the digital economy. At the time of the interview
   Jobs was one such loser himself: his company, NeXT was stumbling, and rival Bill Gates had taken
    Apple's ideas and used them to seize control of the personal computer industry."

According to Cringely the original D1 video tape master was lost in shipping in 1995. When Steve Jobs died in 2011, Triumph of the Nerds director Paul Sen found in his garage a PAL VHS copy of the original unedited interview.[2] Sen informed Cringely that he found this copy and discussed the possibility of releasing it as an independent film. Cringely then contacted Landmark Theatres co-owner Mark Cuban to see if a screening would be possible. Dubbed The Lost Interview, the 70 minute interview screened at 17 theaters around the United States and was later released on DVD in 2012.
